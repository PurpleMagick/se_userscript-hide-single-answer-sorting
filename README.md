## StackExchange hide sorting for a single answer

A userscript that removes the sorting combobox when there is only one answer available.

Before:

[![Before: with one answer to a question, the sorting dropdown is shown][1]][1]

After:

[![After: with one answer to a question, the sorting dropdown is not shown][2]][2]

For users who prefer a cleaner UI when the sorting technically does not make a difference
